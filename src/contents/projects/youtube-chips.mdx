I built a promotional website for Ludens, a student game development club at Kyung Hee University.

## Background

I was frustrated with how easily I'd get distracted. I'd go to YouTube to find a lecture or tutorial, and end up watching game videos or random comedy skits for an hour.
While YouTube's category chips offer some filtering, they don't persist across sessions, lack customization, and often miss the category I need.

## Features

YouTube Chips allows users to save preferred categories, auto-apply them on each visit, and intelligently match to the closest category.
<br/>

**Set Preferred Category**

Save your preferred categories, which are auto-applied whenever you visit YouTube.
The closest matching category is automatically selected if the exact one isn’t available, using OpenAI's embedding model.

<ReactPlayer 
  src="/projects/yc-feat-1.mp4"
  className="mx-auto rounded-lg my-4"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  muted
  loop
  playing
/>

<br/>
**Time Based Category**

Schedule different categories based on day or time (e.g. “Music” during working hours, “Game” on weekends)

<ReactPlayer 
  src="/projects/yc-feat-2.mp4"
  className="mx-auto rounded-lg my-4"
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  muted
  loop
  playing
/>

## What I Did

- Design and develop a Chrome extension using React and TypeScript.
- Implement a FastAPI server on AWS EC2 to identify the most semantically similar category, using OpenAPI's embedding model.
- Collecting usage logs via Firebase to analyze user patterns on YouTube and evaluate the extension’s effectiveness.
