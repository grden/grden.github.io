import ToolTag from '@/components/ToolTags/toolTag';

I built a Tutor matching platform. This full-stack mobile application was developed as part of the KHU SWCON37000 FSSP course.

You can see the full source code at <p className="cursor-pointer underline inline" onClick={() => window.open("https://github.com/grden/indeed", "_blank")}>GitHub</p> â†—.

## What I Built

You can watch a demonstration of the application below (it's narrated in Korean though).

<div className="relative w-full aspect-video my-4">
  <iframe
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGuIFKCO9vs?si=VZl5tT8zyKzqoOuL&start=556"
    title="Project Demo Video"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## What I Did

- Designed using Figma.

<img 
  src="/projects/indeed-figma.png" 
  alt="Figma" 
  className="mx-auto rounded-lg w-full my-4" 
/>

- Built the frontend using Flutter, the backend with Firebase, gRPC and MongoDB.
