I built a promotional website for Ludens, a student game development club at Kyung Hee University.

You can check out the <ArrowLink href="https://khuludens.com" className="font-normal">Ludens web page</ArrowLink>.

## Background

Despite having over 60 members, the club lacked an official introduction or recruitment site. 
At the request of the club president, I led a project to design and develop the website to better represent the club and attract new members.

## What I Did

- Led a 3-person team to design and develop the club’s official website using TypeScript and Next.js.
- Featured a responsive layout, clear information architecture to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
- Used Framer-motion to implement staggered content loading animations and created an RGB glitch effect for the logo to reflect the club’s identity.
- Implemented SEO by configuring meta tags, Open Graph, and sitemap to improve the site's discoverability.

## What I Built

**About Page**
<img 
  src="/projects/ludens-about.png" 
  alt="About Page" 
  className="mx-auto rounded-lg w-full my-4" 
/>
**Projects Page**
<img 
  src="/projects/ludens-projects.png" 
  alt="Projects Page" 
  className="mx-auto rounded-lg w-full my-4" 
/>

## Performance optimization
Using Google Analytics, I identified slow load times on high-traffic, high-bounce-rate pages.
I tried to optimize performance on such pages by restructuring data structure and optimizing images, reducing LCP by up to 1.5s.

/>

## Result
Thanks to implemented UX and search engine visibility, 
the site attracted a steady flow of visitors and played a key role in helping the club grow its membership by approximately 147% compared to the previous semester.
