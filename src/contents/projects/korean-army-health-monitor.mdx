I built a real-time safety monitoring system combining hardware and software to prevent heat-related illnesses among Korean military.

## Background
Due to the rising temperatures caused by climate change, heat-related illnesses have become a critical issue in the Korean military. Existing protocols lacked objective and real-time data to proactively prevent these incidents.

Our team proposed a solution to collect and transmit biometric data directly from soldiers in the field to the command center, enabling preemptive response.

## What I Built
We built a machine learning-based safety monitoring system including Arduino-based smartwatch, a mobile
app, a machine learning backend, and a web dashboard that tracks soldier’s health in real-time and provides alerts to prevent heat-related illnesses in soldiers.

## Predicting Body Temperatures
Even conventional smartwatches, including high-end models like the Apple Watch Series 8, do not directly provide absolute body temperature. 
They only detect relative temperature trends over time, with several limitations:
- They measure skin temperature, not actual core body temperature.
- Users can only view temperature differences compared to the previous day, not real-time values.

<br/>
To overcome these limitations, we implemented a novel machine learning-based method to estimate core body temperature from skin and ambient temperatures
(by referencing <p className="cursor-pointer underline inline" onClick={() => window.open("https://abdn.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/wearable-sensors-based-human-core-body-temperature-computing-meth", "_blank")}>research by Jiang et al.</p> ↗).

<br/>
We collected a custom dataset of 500 samples, pairing actual body temperature (measured using a medical thermometer) with skin and ambient temperature (via our Arduino-based sensor).

</div>

We then found RandomForestRegressor to be the most accurate and efficient model, achieving R² = 0.913 and average inference time under 50ms.
The model is integrated into the system, allowing temperature estimation in the field.

## What I Did
- Participated in a team of 5 as a lead softeware engineer, collaborating with electrical engineering majors.
- Designed and implemented a full data pipeline connecting hardware, mobile app, Firebase backend, FastAPI server, and web dashboard.
- Implemented a Bluetooth-based communication system to transmit sensor data from the hardware to the app.
- Created a machine learning model to estimate core body temperature from skin and ambient temperature.
