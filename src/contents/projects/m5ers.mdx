I was a Software Engineer Intern at <ArrowLink href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bumsoo-kim-439b273/" className="font-normal">M5ers</ArrowLink>, a pre-launch startup, throughout the Winter of 2024.
During my time there, I worked on a zero to one project, going through the design process and
creating a web application to test and manage ASIC-based cryptocurrency mining machines.

<br/>

## What I Did
- Wrote and maintained key technical documentation including Product Requirement Documents (PRD), API specifications, and UML diagrams,
which aligned product vision and developer workflows.
- Built the entire frontend of the application using React and JavaScript.
- Used Jira for agile project management, breaking down tasks and tracking sprint progress.

## What I Built
The tool is designed to interface with custom hardware via UART, providing UI components for status monitoring, 
hardware control (on/off/reset), logging, register-level read/write access, and nonce rolling managementâ€”similar in scope to Bitmain's Management Interface.

## Building a Scalable Foundation
As the project marked the starting point of the system, I focused on building a robust and scalable foundation to support future features and system expansion.

This included:
- Defining clear API boundaries and component responsibilities to support collaboration between teams
- Designing a modular frontend architecture with reusability and maintainability in mind
- Implementing robust error handling across the frontend to ensure system stability and clear feedback during hardware communication failures
- Utilizing Docker to containerize the frontend environment, streamlining development, testing, and deployment across machines

The system is currently being integrated with live hardware.

## The Experience
My internship was located in San Jose.
It was my first time living in the US, and it was a great opportunity to gain this kind of experience.
I tried to make the most of my time there. Even though we had no car(and no driver's license),
the other intern and I made full use of public transport and Uber to explore the entire Bay Area.
