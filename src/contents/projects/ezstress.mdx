I designed and developed a web service that predicts load bottlenecks using AI, performs stress testing, and visualizes the results.

You can see the full source code of the project at <p className="cursor-pointer underline inline" onClick={() => window.open("https://github.com/cloud-computing-team-b", "_blank")}>GitHub</p> â†—.

## Background

Stress testing is essential for ensuring the stability of web services. But many development teams-especially smaller ones-struggle to perform sufficient testing due to its complexity and cost.
This project aims to lower the barrier by providing an automated, fast and easy to use web testing environment(that is also cost-effective!).

## What I Built

EzStress uses LLM to estimate API traffic and automatically generate stress test scenarios based on realistic user patterns.
Built on AWS Fargate, the project aims to support scalable testing and real-time monitoring, offering insightes for service optimization.

**Test Execution Flow**

I tried to implement an intuitive, seamless flow from service registration and authentication to test execution and result analysis.

## Result

EzStress offers two key advantages.
- Cost-efficient: Enables stress testing at under $0.10 per 100 users, avoiding high license or infrastructure costs of traditional tools.
- User-friendly: No scripting or setup required. Users simply specify test parameters, and the system runs automated tests that take only a few hours at most.

## What I Did

- Participated in a 6-person team to design and develop the frontend using TypeScript and React.
- Designed the information architecture, wireframes, and user interface with a strong focus on usability and user experience using Figma.
